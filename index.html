                   Hi all! I'm Brooke - a 27 year old wife and happy pet mom. I grew up on a small farm in Illinois where we grew corn, beans, and hay as well as a plethora of animals. 
                   Growing up on a farm was my favorite! We are animal lovers - so we had an array of dogs, cats, chickens, horses, cattle, sheep, and even a donkey. 
                   Three years ago, my husband and I moved to Nashville for a temporary job opportunity. We loved the state so much we decided to plant our roots and stay a while! 
                   We currently live in a small town just north of Nashville and have some land and a few pets of our own.
                </p>
